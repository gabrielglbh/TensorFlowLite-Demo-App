# TensorFlow Lite Demo

TensorFlow Lite usage demonstration project on Android applied to the classification of images of dogs and cats. In the repository is also attached a MNIST model, CIFAR10 model and MOBILENET model in order to play with various models.

The application demo is based on the classification of random images of cats and dogs extracted from the internet using The Cat API and The Dog API. Before compiling the code, you must register for an API key in https://thecatapi.com/signup in order to fetch cat images and use it as a RequestProperty in the GET petition in APIRequest.kt.

Code is filled with comments and TODOs in order to understand and make the essential changes when changing the cat-vs-dogs model to other ones.
